# üé• Movie Data Analysis Project ‚Äì iScale

This project is focused on analyzing a large movie dataset (`mymoviedb.csv`) using Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. The goal is to clean, process, and visualize data to gain insights such as genre trends, popularity, voting behavior, and movie release patterns over time.

## üìÅ Dataset Overview

- **File Name:** mymoviedb.csv
- **Size:** ~4 MB
- **Total Rows:** 9,827 (expanded to 25,552 after processing)
- **Columns Included:**
  - `Release_Date`
  - `Title`
  - `Overview`
  - `Popularity`
  - `Vote_Count`
  - `Vote_Average`
  - `Original_Language`
  - `Genre`
  - `Poster_Url`

---

## üßπ Data Cleaning and Preparation

Steps performed:

- Converted `Release_Date` into year format (`int`).
- Removed unnecessary columns: `Overview`, `Original_Language`, `Poster_Url`.
- Checked and confirmed no missing or duplicated values.
- Categorized `Vote_Average` into:
  - `not_popular`
  - `below_avg`
  - `average`
  - `popular`
- Split and exploded `Genre` column for better analysis (each genre in a separate row).
